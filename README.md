# Random Bash scrips

Just some random bash scripts which may be useful:

#### [7 Zip Backup Generator](https://github.com/CJ0206/Random-Bash/blob/main/7%20Zip%20Backup%20Generator.bat)
This script requires [7 Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to be installed under `C:\Program Files\7-Zip`
- Change `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop` to the directory you want to backup.
- Change `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Desktop` to where you want the backup to be saved.
- Change `Backup.zip` to a more descriptive name of what you're backing up.
- The backup directory will open once complete so you can view your new zip file
