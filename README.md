# Random Bash scrips

Just some random bash scripts which may be useful:

## [7 Zip Backup Generator](https://github.com/CJ0206/Random-Bash/blob/main/7%20Zip%20Backup%20Generator.bat)
This script requires [7 Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to be installed under `C:\Program Files\7-Zip`
- Change `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop` to the directory you want to backup.
- Change `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Desktop` to where you want the backup to be saved.
- Change `Backup.zip` to a more descriptive name of what you're backing up.
- The backup directory will open once complete so you can view your new zip file

*[Backup TP to OneDrive.bat](https://github.com/CJ0206/Random-Bash/blob/main/Backup%20TP%20to%20OneDrive.bat) closes [Touch Portal](https://www.touch-portal.com/), creates a [manual backup](https://www.touch-portal.com/faq.php?faqId=restoring-touch-portal-backups) and saves it to the TouchPortal folder in my One Drive.*

*[Backup OBS to OneDrive.bat](https://github.com/CJ0206/Random-Bash/blob/main/Backup%20OBS%20to%20OneDrive.bat) is a slightly modified version of [nutty's Backup All Your OBS Settins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imPH4YzBaZg) which zips a [portable version of OBS](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-and-obs-studio-portable-mode-on-windows.359/) so it can be completely restored if something goes wrong.*
